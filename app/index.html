    <div class="slide" id="slide1">
		<div class="intro">
			<h1>Gold</h1>
			<p>richness, happy, prosperous, successful, extremely valuable</p>
		</div>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide2">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...bewitched to a dark gold"</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      "On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against
      salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...slender golden arm"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden."</h3>
      <p>Gold represents Jordan’s status of near unreachability - she is, despite her flaws in personality, a catch. Jordan possesses beauty, as well as wealth, making her desired and appealing to the eyes, like gold.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...the golden girl"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. .. high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. .."</h3>
      <p>The color gold is used here to describe a stereotype that Daisy seems to fit. The “golden girl” of the “white palace” conjures up an image of a young, innocent girl living with the greatest wealth and protection.</p>
  </div>
	</div>
<!--END GOLD-->


<!--YELLOW-->
	<div class="section" id="section3">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1">
		<div class="intro">
			<h1>Yellow</h1>
			<p>The color of gold, which symbolizes money, materialism and high social position.</p>
		</div>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide2">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...bewitched to a dark gold"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New."</h3>
      <p>Yellow is a recurring motif associated with the inevitable death with a corrupt and lavish heart.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...two girls in yellow"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "...we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men.."</h3>
      <p>In contrast to the golden girl Jordan, her admirers are only yellow.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...yellow cocktail music"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music"</h3>
      <p> the richness is only a cover, a short sensation, like the yellow press for the more offensively sensational press.</p>
  </div>
	</div>


  <!--END YELLOW-->


<!--WHITE-->
  <div class="section" id="section4">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1">
		<div class="intro">
			<h1>White</h1>
			<p>morally unblemished, honorable</p>
		</div>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide2">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...white palaces"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "Across the courtesy the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water..."</h3>
      <p>White is associated with the old money lifestyle of the ones that live on East Egg.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"... both in white"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around
the house."</h3>
      <p>Jordan and Daisy are both viewed as pure and innocent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...a white card from his wallet"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man's eyes."</h3>
      <p>White contributes to power because in this paragraph Gatsby was pulled over for speeding and by waving this card in the policemans face he was able to leave without any problems.</p>
  </div>
	</div>
<!--END WHITE-->

<!--blue-->
  <div class="section" id="section5">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1">
		<div class="intro">
			<h1>Blue</h1>
			<p>melancholy, loneliness, tranquility and fantasy</p>
		</div>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide2">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...his blue gardens"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "In his blue gardens men and girls came and went..."</h3>
      <p>Blue is usedas a symbol of poverty. We can also tie into this that as opposed to white collar, blue symbolizes the blue collar working class.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...blue and gigantic"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high."</h3>
      <p>They may represent God staring down upon and judging American society as a moral wasteland, though the novel never makes this point explicitly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...a dash of blue paint"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      " A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car."</h3>
      <p>Blue here is significant because Daisy's hair clearly is not blue, so it must symbolize a feeling. Her lavender hat combined with this sets the stage with cool colors to foreshadow the day that will turn out to contain tears and disappointments.</p>
  </div>
	</div>
  <!--END BLUE-->


<!--START RED-->
  <div class="section" id="section6">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1">

  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide2">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...they stood on my shelf in red and gold"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint..."</h3>
      <p>While the gold is associated with red here, it means that the worship and obtain of money is closely associated with blood and violence in that age.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...where new red gas-pumps sat"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. "</h3>
      <p>In this sentence, the author not only uses the color “red”, but also uses the word “pool”, which indicates the ending of the story.</p>
  </div>
	</div>

  <!--END RED-->

  <!--START GREY-->
  <div class="section" id="section7">
    <div class="slide" id="slide1">

      <h1>"...the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust..."</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which dri  endlessly over it, you perceive, a er a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg."</h3>
      <p>The valley of ashes is a grey place where everything is colored grey.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...a line of grey cars"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight."</h3>
      <p>Every grey thing in the Valley of Ashes makes people feel depressed, hopeless and afflicted.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape."</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape."</h3>
      <p>This indicates Mr. Wilson’s painful state of mind and his determination to kill the owner of the yellow car.</p>
