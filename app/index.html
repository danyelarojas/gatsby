			<h1>Gold</h1>
			<p>richness, happy, prosperous, successful, extremely valuable</p>
		</div>

    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...bewitched to a dark gold"</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      "On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against
      salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...slender golden arm"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden."</h3>
      <p>Gold represents Jordan’s status of near unreachability - she is, despite her flaws in personality, a catch. Jordan possesses beauty, as well as wealth, making her desired and appealing to the eyes, like gold.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...the golden girl"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it. .. high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl. .."</h3>
      <p>The color gold is used here to describe a stereotype that Daisy seems to fit. The “golden girl” of the “white palace” conjures up an image of a young, innocent girl living with the greatest wealth and protection.</p>
  </div>

    </div>
    <h3>
      "It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New."</h3>
      <p>Yellow is a recurring motif associated with the inevitable death with a corrupt and lavish heart.</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...two girls in yellow"</h1>

      <h1>"...yellow cocktail music"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music"</h3>
      <p> the richness is only a cover, a short sensation, like the yellow press for the more offensively sensational press.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>
      "Across the courtesy the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water..."</h3>
      <p>White is associated with the old money lifestyle of the ones that live on East Egg.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide3">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"... both in white"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around
the house."</h3>
      <p>Jordan and Daisy are both viewed as pure and innocent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <div class="intro">
      <h1>"...a white card from his wallet"</h1>
    </div>
    <h3>
      "Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man's eyes."</h3>
      <p>White contributes to power because in this paragraph Gatsby was pulled over for speeding and by waving this card in the policemans face he was able to leave without any problems.</p>
